    ger_medium_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Panzerkampfwagen I was a light tank designed for training, armed with two MG13. Entering production in 1933, its armor was enough to stop small arms fire but its firepower was not suited for combat against tanks of any kind. Speed and reliability were excellent though, making the tank very suitable for the German Bewegungskrieg."

Going into production in 1937, it was basically an enlarged and improved 1936 Panzer I able to pierce other light tanks. It featured good speed and reliability, making it well suited for Bewegungskrieg against unprepared opponents. It was meant to be the main tank of the early Panzer-Divisions."

    ger_medium_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Panzer III was a medium tank armed with a 3.7-cm-KwK 36 L/45, first entering full production in 1939. Quick, relatively lightly armed and armored the Panzer III was nonetheless an excellent vehicle setting the standard for optimal crew size for decades to come. With its 3-men-turret, intercom and radio system it allowed for superior coordination compared to other designs and coordinated high speed advances, the core of the German combined arms warfare."

    ger_medium_tank_chassis_4_desc:0 "The Panzer IV was a heavy medium tank armed with a 7.5-cm-KwK 37 L/24. With the first combat-capable version entering production in 1938, the Panzer IV supported the other tanks with anti-infantry fire from its short-barreled main gun, mostly firing high explosive ammunition. It was almost useless against other tanks though."

Introduced in 1943 to finally counter the Soviet T-34, the Panther was a supreme vehicle for its time, finally featuring angled armor, an excellent gun and very broad tracks. Able to pierce any enemy tank, combined with its heavy armor and good mobility it was a very strong tank but suffered from a problematic engine as also high production costs."

First proposed already in 1942, the E-50 was part of an attempt to streamline and optimize tank production across a whole so-called Entwicklungsserie (development series). Combining parts from various previous tanks and newly developed, unified components for the different weight classes of the E-series, this vehicle would have been the new mainstay of the German armored forces ready for true mass production."

    ger_light_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Panzer II Luchs was a light tank armed with a 2-cm-KwK 38 L/55. Developed in 1942 as a dedicated recon tank and a major redesign of the obsolete Panzer II, it featured an additional crew member, increased range and speed as also improved cross-country capability and somewhat improved armor. Nonetheless it was far too weakly armed to be a threat to anything but lightly armored vehicles."

    GER_ger_light_tank_chassis_4:0 "Leopard"

    ger_light_tank_chassis_4_desc:0  "The Leopard was a light tank armed with a 5-cm-KwK 39 L/60 in development until 1943. A dedicated recon tank and an almost total redesign of the venerable Panzer II chassis, it featured massively improved  though still weak armor, an improved suspension, excellent cross-country capability, high speed and significantly improved firepower with the same gun as the Panzer III. It was also very costly to produce."

    ger_light_tank_chassis_5:0 "1946  @GER  Light Tank"

    ger_light_tank_chassis_5_short:0 "E-10"
    ger_light_tank_chassis_5_desc:0  "The E-10 was a light tank armed with a 7.5-cm-Pak 39 L/48 gun, developed until 1945. Part of the standardization program called Entwicklungsserie, it was a highly unusual recon tank with a secondary tank destroyer role. Its chassis could be lowered pneumatically by 40% for better concealment in ambush positions, making it extremely dangerous on the defense."

    ### Infantry Tank ###
    
    ger_modern_tank_chassis_1:0 "1934  @GER Infantry Tank"
    GER_ger_modern_tank_chassis_1:0 "Neubaufahrzeug Chassis"
    ger_modern_tank_chassis_1_short:0 "Neubaufahrzeug"
    ger_modern_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Neubaufahrzeug was a heavy tank armed with a  7.5-cm-KwK 37 L/24 and a 3.7-cm-KwK 36 L/45 as also two separate MG turrets sporting MG34s. This lumbering behemoth of a supposed medium tank was put into service in 1936. As an utter failure, it was too heavy, too slow, the mixed armament was problematic in terms of ammunition storage, the vibrating chassis made precise aiming very difficult, its armor was far too thin for such a big vehicle and the additional MG turrets caused communication issues."

    ### Heavy Tanks ###
    
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_1:0 "1942  @GER Heavy Tank"
    GER_ger_heavy_tank_chassis_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. E Chassis"
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_1_short:0 "Tiger I"
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a heavy tank armed with an 8.8-cm-KwK 36 L/56. First produced in 1942, this famous vehicle was the most heavily armed and armored of its kind at the time. Designed to combat and defeat the strongest Soviet tanks, its main gun was capable of piercing anything that stood in its way, and its armor could shrug off even the heaviest available enemy anti-tank guns. While being more nimble than one would expect, it was a complicated and quite intricate machine that needed a lot of maintenance and was difficult to produce."
    
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_2:0 "1944  @GER Heavy Tank"
    GER_ger_heavy_tank_chassis_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B"
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_2_short:0 "Tiger II"
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "The Tiger II was a heavy tank armed with an 8.8-cm-KwK 43 L/71. Developed in 1943 initially as just an improved Tiger I with a bigger gun, the whole project quickly became a much different beast, literally. Adopting sloped armor and an improved turret face as also a long 8.8cm gun, this vehicle was the ultimate German heavy tank of the Second World War with almost unrivaled firepower. With massive armor and gun came equally massive drawbacks, the Tiger II was very unreliable, slow and extremely costly to produce."
    
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_3:0 "1947  @GER Heavy Tank"
    GER_ger_heavy_tank_chassis_3:0 "E-75 Standardpanzer"
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_3_short:0 "E-75"
    ger_heavy_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The E-75 was a heavy tank armed with a 10.5-cm-KwK 46 L/52. Part of the planned E series of tanks meant to standardize parts across all tanks of the German forces in 1945 and ease mass production, this vehicle was the natural progression from the Tiger II. Bigger, heavier armed and armored it would have been capable of breaking even the heaviest of defenses while possessing a better engine and suspension to stay at least as mobile as its predecessor, while due to standardization being actually cheaper to produce."
    
    ### Super-heavy Tanks ###
    
    ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_1:0 "1944  @GER Super-Heavy Tank"
    GER_ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_1:0 "Maus"
    ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_1_short:0 "Maus"
    ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Maus was a super-heavy tank armed with a 12.8-cm-KwK L/55 and a 7.5-cm-KwK 44 L/36.5. Proposed by Porsche and Prototyped in 1944 this colossal machine was the ultimate result of the drive to prioritize weapon and armor over literally anything else. While it excelled at both, its speed was virtually nonexistent, turning the tank into little more than a moving bunker. Its reliability was at least questionable, the production costs off the charts. And it should not have tried to use bridges. Except if you didn’t like bridges."
    
    ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_2:0 "1946  @GER Super-Heavy Tank"
    GER_ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_2:0 "E 100"
    ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_2_short:0 "E 100"
    ger_super_heavy_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "The E-100 was a super-heavy tank armed with a 15-cm-KwK 44 L/38. Developed from 1942 on by the Adler-Werke, this vehicle was the only one of the E series tanks to reach something close to completion. With less armor, thus higher speed and a stronger gun than the Maus this monstrosity was actually mildly more viable. Somewhat cheaper but still very costly to produce, the E-100 was still less than useful on the battlefield."

    ### Amphibious Tanks ###

    GER_ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_2:0 "Schwimmpanzer II Chassis"
    ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_2_short:0 "Schwimmpanzer II"
    ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "The Schwimmpanzer II was an amphibious version of the Panzer II. Fitted with additional floatation devices and a propeller, it looked a bit like a boat. It was surprisingly quick and quite stable, making it a solid early amphibious tank for river crossings or naval invasion support."
    
    ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_38:0 "1940  @GER  Amphibious Tank"
    GER_ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_38:0 "Schwimmpanzer 38(t) Chassis"
    ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_38_short:0 "Schwimmpanzer 38(t)"
    ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_38_desc:0  "The Schwimmpanzer 38(t) was the amphibious version of the regular model. First drawn up in 1940, it was fitted with additional floatation devices and a propeller similar to the Schwimmpanzer II. Due to its pretty good gun, it would have added a nice extra punch to any river crossing or naval invasion but never went into production"

    ger_amphibious_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Tauchpanzer III was the amphibious version of the regular Panzer III. Developed in 1940, it was a relatively simple conversion, all openings were sealed with rubber, duct tape and tar. Sporting a bilge pump and an 18 meters long snorkel hose tied to a buoy with radio antenna, it was meant to drive on the ground of the English Channel for the invasion of the United Kingdom. They were also useful for opposed river crossings."
