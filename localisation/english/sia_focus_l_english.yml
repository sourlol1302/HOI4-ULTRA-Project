 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_desc:0 "Since the revolution of 1932 and the abolition of the old absolute monarchy, Siam has become a constitutional kingdom led by the Radical Party, Khana Ratsadon. While the new regime is far different form the old order, the lack of democratization, the rampant corruption and infighting within the party are starting to threaten even the powerful Phahon. Meanwhile, more radical elements of the party led by Phibun are waiting for the opportunity of seizing power and apply their own vision of Siam, inspired by Japan and the authoritarian states of Europe.
